# Data Structure Implementations for Python

Different data structure types are commonly used for efficient development. That is the reason why we need to learn them.
Main data structures are implemented in this repository. These data structures are:

1. Stack 
2. Linked List 
3. Queue (and as a special type Priority queue) 
4. Tree (Binary Search Tree and AVL or Balanced Tree)
5. Set (Before set implementation, we need to understand hashmap or dictionary)
